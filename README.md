# Daedalus-attack
The code of our paper "Daedalus: Breaking Non-Maximum Suppression in Object Detection via Adversarial Examples".
We propose an attack, in which we can tune the strength of the attack and specify the object category to attack, to break non-maximum suppression (NMS) in object detection. As the consequence, the detection model outputs extremely dense results as the redundant detections are not filtered by NMS.

Some results are displayed here:
